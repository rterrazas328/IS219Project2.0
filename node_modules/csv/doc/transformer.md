Transformations may occur synchronously or asynchronously depending
on the provided transform callback and its declared arguments length.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Callbacks are called for each line, with these arguments:

Callback are called for each line and its arguments are :

*   *index*   
  Incremented counter
*   *callback*   
  Callback function to be called in asynchronous mode

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you specify the `columns` read option, the `row` argument will be 
provided as an object with keys matching columns names. Otherwise it
will be provided as an array.

Unless you specify the `columns` read option, the `row` argument will be 
provided as an array, otherwise it will be provided as an object with keys 
matching columns names.

In synchronous mode, the contract is quite simple, you will receive an array 
of fields for each record and the transformed array should be returned.

In asynchronous mode, it is your responsibility to call the callback 
provided as the third argument. It must be called with two arguments,
<<<<<<< HEAD
an error (if any), and the transformed record.

Transformed records may be an array, an associative array, a 
string or `null`. If `null`, the record will simply be skipped. When the
returned value is an array, the fields are merged in order. 
When the returned value is an object, the module will search for
the `columns` property in the write or in the read options and 
intelligently order the values. If no `columns` options are found, 
it will merge the values in their order of appearance. When the 
returned value is a string, it is directly sent to the destination 
and it is your responsibility to delimit, quote, escape

the first one is an error if any, the second is the transformed record.

When the returned value is an object, it will search for

or define line breaks.

Transform callback run synchronously:

```javascript

csv()
.from('82,Preisner,Zbigniew\n94,Gainsbourg,Serge')
.to(console.log)
.transform(function(row, index){
    return row.reverse()
});
// Executing `node samples/transform.js`, print:
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Zbigniew,Preisner,82\nSerge,Gainsbourg,94
=======
// 94,Gainsbourg,Serge\n82,Preisner,Zbigniew
>>>>>>> 923637243c51b35e8862bfced9d2f31719759a83

```

Transform callback run asynchronously:

```javascript

csv()
.from('82,Preisner,Zbigniew\n94,Gainsbourg,Serge')
.to(console.log)
.transform(function(row, index, callback){
    process.nextTick(function(){
        callback(null, row.reverse());
    });
});
// Executing `node samples/transform.js`, print:
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Zbigniew,Preisner,82\nSerge,Gainsbourg,94

// 94,Gainsbourg,Serge\n82,Preisner,Zbigniew
>>>>>>> 923637243c51b35e8862bfced9d2f31719759a83

```

Transform callback returning a string:

```javascript

csv()
.from('82,Preisner,Zbigniew\n94,Gainsbourg,Serge')
.to(console.log)
.transform(function(row, index){
    return (index>0 ? ',' : '') + row[0] + ":" + row[2] + ' ' + row[1];
});
// Executing `node samples/transform.js`, print:
// 82:Zbigniew Preisner,94:Serge Gainsbourg
```
